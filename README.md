🔭 I’m currently studying Web Development at the COTEPECOS! I'm interested about everything related to technology
right now I'm still learning about Javascript, HTML, CSS and others.

Last year I obtained the AZ-900 Certification from Microsoft which is a great achievement for me. I'm looking for new certifications about different fields of technology. 

I would like to be part of this amazing family of Programming. I really love this community and what it does.
